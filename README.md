## Overview

The Dual Beam Oscilloscope Simulation Software allows users to visualize waveforms and analyze signals in real-time. This simulation software is ideal for students, engineers, and hobbyists who want to understand oscilloscopes without the need for physical hardware. Built using JavaFX, it offers a user-friendly interface and smooth performance.

## Features

- **Dual Beam Display**: Simulate two signals simultaneously for easy comparison.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Observe waveforms as they change in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls make navigation simple.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust time base, voltage scale, and trigger settings.
- **Export Functionality**: Save waveforms and settings for later analysis.
- **Educational Resources**: Includes tutorials and guides for beginners.

## Installation

To install the Dual Beam Oscilloscope Simulation Software, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Ankithrao0177/Dual_Beam_Oscilloscope_Simulation_Software/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded file to your preferred location.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder.
4. Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   java -jar DualBeamOscilloscope.jar
   ```

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. If not, download and install the latest version from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see the main interface with the following components:

- **Waveform Display**: This area shows the two waveforms being simulated.
- **Control Panel**: Use the sliders and buttons to adjust settings such as time base and voltage scale.
- **Trigger Settings**: Set the trigger level and mode to stabilize the waveform display.
- **Menu Bar**: Access additional features such as saving and loading configurations.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Select Waveform Type**: Choose from options like sine, square, and triangle waves.
2. **Adjust Settings**: Use the control panel to set the desired frequency and amplitude.
3. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to begin visualizing the waveforms.
4. **Analyze Results**: Observe the waveforms and make adjustments as needed.
5. **Export Data**: Use the export feature to save your settings and waveforms for future reference.
