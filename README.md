## Dual-Beam Oscilloscope Simulation Software
- Generates time-domain waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth) for two channels using `WaveformGenerator`, allowing users to configure frequency (via text fields), amplitude (via sliders), and AC/DC coupling (via choice boxes), with added noise and slow modulation for realism.
- Renders analog waveforms on a canvas with a textured gradient background and a grid (major divisions every 1/10th width, minor every 1/50th), scaling signals based on user-defined voltage per division (0.1 to 10 V/div) and timebase (0.001 to 1 s/div) settings.
- Implements edge-based triggering on CH1 or CH2 for rising or falling slopes, detecting the first crossing of a user-set trigger level (-10 to 10 V) and shifting waveforms to align the trigger point, ensuring stable visualization.
- Performs mathematical operations on CH1 and CH2 via `MathChannel`, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication (normalized to prevent overflow), differentiation, and integration, with results displayed in a user-selectable color (green, red, blue, yellow) and adjustable voltage scale/position.
- Computes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using `FFT` for CH1, CH2, and math channels, producing magnitude and phase spectra up to a user-defined maximum frequency (10 to 5000 Hz), with configurable FFT size (256 to 8192) based on resolution bandwidth (RBW) selection.
- Supports five FFT window functions (Rectangular, Hamming, Blackman, Kaiser, Gaussian) via `WindowFunction`, normalizing windows to unity gain and applying them to reduce spectral leakage, with Kaiser using a modified Bessel function approximation.
- Detects spectral peaks above a statistical threshold (mean + 2 standard deviations) using `PeakDetector`, identifying harmonics relative to the fundamental frequency, calculating SNR, and optionally annotating peaks with frequency, magnitude, and harmonic order on the spectrum display.
- Dynamically updates RBW choices (1 to 100 Hz) based on sample rate (800 samples / timebase), ensuring FFT resolution aligns with the current timebase, and recalculates spectra when RBW or window type changes.
- Decodes digital protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN) from CH1 and CH2 using `ProtocolDecoder`, detecting transitions above a 0.5 V threshold, extracting messages (e.g., I2C data bytes, SPI frames, UART characters, CAN IDs), and displaying results with timestamps in a text area.
- Demodulates AM, FM, or PM signals from CH1 using `Demodulator`, employing envelope detection for AM, phase differentiation for FM, and phase extraction for PM, displaying the baseband signal (purple trace) with adjustable scale/position and reporting carrier frequency and modulation parameters (index or deviation).
- Simulates modulated signals in a separate 700x600 window (`modulation.fxml`) controlled by `ModulationController`, generating AM, FM, or PM waveforms with adjustable carrier frequency (100 to 1000 Hz), modulating frequency (1 to 100 Hz), and modulation parameters (index 0–1 for AM, deviation 0–500 Hz for FM, phase deviation 0–π rad for PM), visualized with a retro grid and phosphor effects.
- Visualizes eye diagrams for NRZ or PAM4 signals in a 700x600 window (`eyeDiagram.fxml`) controlled by `EyeDiagramController`, simulating 1000 overlaid traces with configurable bit rate (1 to 1000 Mbps), amplitude (0.1 to 2 V), noise (0 to 100 mV RMS), and jitter (0 to 100 ps RMS), calculating metrics like eye height, eye width, jitter (RMS and peak-to-peak), and time interval error (TIE).
- Applies visual effects to waveforms and spectra, including a Gaussian blur (radius 1.0) and glow (level 0.7) for a phosphor-like CRT display, with distinct colors for CH1 (yellow), CH2 (cyan), math channel (user-selectable), and baseband (purple).
- Provides an interactive UI with sliders (timebase, voltage, amplitude, trigger level, max frequency, dynamic range), choice boxes (wave type, coupling, trigger source/slope, FFT window, protocol, demodulation, math operation), buttons (run/stop, spectrum toggle, digital toggle, compare spectra, modulation window), and text fields (frequency), all styled with retro CSS (e.g., 3D borders, beige panels).
- Updates UI labels in real-time to reflect slider values (e.g., "Timebase: 0.100 s/div", "CH1: 1.00 V/div"), and validates frequency inputs, highlighting invalid entries (non-positive or non-numeric) with a red border.
- Toggles between time-domain (waveforms), frequency-domain (magnitude/phase spectra), and digital signal displays (binary traces offset from analog waveforms), with a run/stop button to pause/resume waveform updates.
- Supports spectrum comparison mode, plotting CH1, CH2, and math channel spectra on a single scale (using CH1’s voltage/position) or separately (using respective scales), with adjustable dynamic range (-100 to 0 dB) for dB-scale spectra.
- Uses CSS (`oscilloscope.css`, `modulation.css`, `eyeDiagram.css`) to style UI components with a retro look, featuring 3D borders (#808080/#FFFFFF), beige backgrounds (#F0E68C), and Consolas font, with hover/pressed states for sliders and buttons.
- Drives real-time visualization at ~60 FPS using `AnimationTimer`, updating waveforms, spectra, protocol decoding, and demodulation only when parameters change (e.g., timebase, frequency, trigger settings), optimizing performance by caching last-known values.
- Handles errors gracefully, displaying messages for invalid inputs (e.g., "Error: Invalid timebase") or failed operations (e.g., "Error: No valid I2C frames detected") in protocol output or alerts (e.g., for missing FXML files).
